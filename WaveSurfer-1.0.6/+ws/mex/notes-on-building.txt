The project settings for all of these are similar to what you would
get if you did, e.g.:

mex -largeArrayDims minMaxDownsampleMex.cpp

within Matlab.

If you instead do 

mex -v -compatibleArrayDims minMaxDownsampleMex.cpp

then Matlab adds the command-line switch /DMX_COMPAT_32 when
compiling, which #defines MX_COMPAT_32, and leads to mwSize/mwIndex
being 32-bit quantities.

We don't #define MX_COMPAT_32 when we compile from within VS, so we
should be getting 64-bit mwSize/mwIndex variables.

As of this writing, used VS2015 to build these.
