classdef UserClass < handle
    % The superclass from which user classes should inherit.  Contains methods
    % that get called at various points, including during a run.
    %
    % A user class should include a zero-argument constructor.  Any initialization
    % requiring information from the WavesurferModel should be done in the wake()
    % method, which takes the root model as an argument.  By checking the class of
    % the rootModel, initialization can be customized to the process.
    %
    % Any non-transient, non-dependent properties of the user object are saved
    % to the protocol file, and are also serialized and sent to the refiller
    % and loooper at the start of each run.      

    methods (Abstract=true)
        wake(self, wsModel)
          % Called once after the user object is created, reinstantiated, or loaded from a
          % protocol file.  Note that when a protocol file is loaded, a user object
          % is first created in a temporary version of the WavesurferModel, then if
          % that succeeds, the one true WavesurferModel is made to mimic the temporary
          % one.  But wake() is only called on the user object after this.  Thus the
          % non-transient, non-dependent properties of the user object should be set
          % as in the protocol file, but the transient properties will generally not
          % be set to sensible values.  If needed, the wake() method should set
          % the transient values to preserve any user object invarients.
