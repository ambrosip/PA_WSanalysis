developers.  You can safely ignore it.



Demo 1: Basics
--------------

On breakout box, connect AO0 to AI0, AO1 to AI1

Start wavesurfer

Check stim, overwrite without asking boxes

Show acquire

Show Device & Channels window, show effects of changing units, scale

Show that can change # of sweeps per run

Show can have amplitude be a function of sweep #  (e.g. 2*i, i^2, 5*mod(i,2))

Show pulse train, sine, chirp, expression (tan() example) stimuli

Show can add channels by adding another AI, another AO

Show maps by making train out 1, chirp out 2

Show sequences by making a reversed map, alternating between them

Show continuous acquisition

Show saving of protocols

Show fast protocols




Demo 2: Electrodes, test pulsing, amp integration
-------------------------------------------------

Quit, launch WS

Bring up the Device & Channels panel

Show electrodes, test pulse

Show HEKA interface

Show user functions: ws.examples.ExampleUserClass





Demo 3: Online analysis and real-time feedback loop
---------------------------------------------------

Run Ben's demo:
    Connect AO0 to AI0, AO1 to AI1.
    Jumper P0.0 to P0.2, P0.1 to P0.3.
    Run ws.testTreadmillWithoutProtocolFile()
    Arrange plots as needed.




Demo 4: Soft Real-Time feedback loops
-------------------------------------

Show user function latency:
    On breakout box, wire P0.0 to USER1
    Connect fungen output to scope channel 1, AI0
    Set up fungen to do 10 Hz TTL output, 50% DC
    Connect USER1 to scope channel 2
    Set up scope to trigger on CH1, mode AUTO, set level at +2.5 V on
        channel 1
    Start wavesurfer
    Delete the AO channel
    Add a DO channel, *** Set DO channel to untimed! ***
    Set to continuous acq
    ws.examples.MimicAnalogInputWithDigitalOutput
    Should get less than 5 ms latency on CH2 for rising edges




    






    






Axon demo
---------

Show mode change

Show VC gain changes, monitor then command

Show that CC gain changes don't register while in VC mode

Switch to CC mode, show that change is reflected

Show CC mode gain changes

Show that if you change the primary output, trode goes red

Add second amplifier, start another MCC instance

Reconnect
